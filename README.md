# Movie-Databse

This is a project I built as an introduction to OOP in Java.
It started out as a database for movies and series, but ended up consisting only of movies. Also, this was my first attempt on making an application in JavaFX, although when I started writing the program it was only intended to be a console application.

The program reads in 1000 movies from the file 'filer_1000.csv' and displays them in a list. From there you can edit, remove or add any movie.
